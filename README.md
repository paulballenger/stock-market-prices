# stock-market-prices

An exploration of historical S&P 500 stocks prices to examine trends - specifically, to see if the stock market performance on one day affects the probably of a change in direction the next day.

For project, I looked at trends:
* How many days stock market closing prices rose or dropped before changing direction
* Percent gain or loss when change of direction ocurred

Next, I looked for correlations.
